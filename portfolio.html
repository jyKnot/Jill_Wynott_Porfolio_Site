              <div class="portfolio-description-content hidden">
                <p> In 2022, the Whistler Sailing Association launched an exciting two-phase initiative to modernize its digital presence. With a hired contractor, the first goal was to deliver a clean website that would serve as a reliable hub for program information, events, and membership details. The second was more ambitious: to integrate a customized online booking system that would simplify registration and reduce administrative workload. While Phase 1 was completed successfully, Phase 2 marked a dramatic shift. <p>
                <p>The booking system—intended to streamline operations—quickly began to unravel. Despite early optimism, the developer failed to deliver a usable product. As bugs, gaps, and inefficiencies mounted, the project consumed its budget and strained internal capacity. Families grew frustrated with registration and payment issues, while staff were pulled into hours of manual troubleshooting. The very tool meant to strengthen the organization had instead become its greatest liability.</p>
                <p>Confronted with a system in collapse, I stepped in to take decisive action. After reviewing the technical, financial, and operational implications, I made the call to halt development entirely. Rather than continue investing in an unstable product, I led a strategic pivot: rebuilding the site from the ground up and rethinking the solution with clarity and focus.</p>
                <p>I delivered a new site using WIX, one which gave the organization digital independence, and implemented Checkfront, a robust, user-friendly third-party booking platform that aligned with the real operational needs. The system allowed for quick rollout of features including lesson registration, membership payments, and boat rentals without the ongoing costs and risks of custom development. It was intuitive for staff, reliable for users, and sustainable for the organization.</p>
                <p>The outcome was immediate and measurable: registrations became frictionless, administrative workload dropped significantly, and user satisfaction rose. The community responded with positive feedback, and the internal team regained confidence in managing digital tools. What began as a derailed project became a compelling example of adaptive leadership and strategic recovery.</p>
                <p>This experience reinforced several lasting lessons for me:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Simplicity scales A lean, well-matched solution often outperforms custom builds when time, budget, and resources are limited.</li>
                    <p><li>Do your reference checks. A vendor’s experience is critical. Don’t fund someone else’s learning curve with your hard earned budget.</li></p>
                    <p><li>Choose aligned partners. Work with people who share your values, not just your contract. Partners should be invested in your success, and recommend what’s truly best for your organization.</li></p>
                    <p><li>Build for sustainability. Tools should empower teams long-term, not lock them into external dependency.</li></p>
                    <p><li>Adaptability is a superpower. When plans collapse, a well-informed pivot can turn failure into lasting success.</li></p>

              <div class="portfolio-description-content hidden">
                <p>Every year, the Resort Municipality of Whistler (RMOW) produces a comprehensive Corporate Plan and Annual Report to outline its strategic priorities, key performance indicators, and departmental achievements. Given its importance as both a public-facing and internal planning document, it needs to be clear, visually engaging, and reflective of the community’s identity.</p>
                <p>I’ve been responsible for designing this report annually for several years. Each year, I collaborate with internal departments to gather content, understand evolving priorities, and ensure the design reflects both current municipal goals and the established RMOW brand.</p>
                <p>For the <a href="https://www.whistler.ca/wp-content/uploads/2025-Corporate-Plan-2024-Annual-Report-_-June-18-2024-1.pdf" target="_blank">2025 edition</a>, I was inspired by the intersection of our increasingly digital world and Whistler’s deep connection to nature. To represent this balance, I integrated stylized generated wireframe animal illustrations throughout the report—symbols of local wildlife rendered in a modern, geometric form. These visuals bridged the organic and the digital, subtly reinforcing RMOW’s vision of progress rooted in environmental stewardship.</p>
                <p>I apply consistent typographic hierarchy and visual structure to make the report easy to navigate, while also updating elements year over year to keep the design fresh. I also ensure the final product is accessible and optimized for digital publication, following best practices for accessible PDFs.</p>
                <p>The finished Corporate Plan was delivered on schedule and well-received by Council and staff. It continues to serve as a key resource for both strategic reference and public communication, and my ongoing involvement each year has helped maintain a consistent, high-quality standard for this critical municipal document.</p>
