                <p>
                  In 2022, the Whistler Sailing Association launched an exciting
                  two-phase initiative to modernize its digital presence. With a
                  hired contractor, the first goal was to deliver a clean
                  website that would serve as a reliable hub for program
                  information, events, and membership details. The second was
                  more ambitious: to integrate a customized online booking
                  system that would simplify registration and reduce
                  administrative workload. While Phase 1 was completed
                  successfully, Phase 2 marked a dramatic shift.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The booking system—intended to streamline operations—quickly
                  began to unravel. Despite early optimism, the developer failed
                  to deliver a usable product. As bugs, gaps, and inefficiencies
                  mounted, the project consumed its budget and strained internal
                  capacity. Families grew frustrated with registration and
                  payment issues, while staff were pulled into hours of manual
                  troubleshooting. The very tool meant to strengthen the
                  organization had instead become its greatest liability.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Confronted with a system in collapse, I stepped in to take
                  decisive action. After reviewing the technical, financial, and
                  operational implications, I made the call to halt development
                  entirely. Rather than continue investing in an unstable
                  product, I led a strategic pivot: rebuilding the site from the
                  ground up and rethinking the solution with clarity and focus.
                </p>
                <p>
                  I delivered a new site using WIX, one which gave the
                  organization digital independence, and implemented Checkfront,
                  a robust, user-friendly third-party booking platform that
                  aligned with the real operational needs. The system allowed
                  for quick rollout of features including lesson registration,
                  membership payments, and boat rentals without the ongoing
                  costs and risks of custom development. It was intuitive for
                  staff, reliable for users, and sustainable for the
                  organization.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The outcome was immediate and measurable: registrations became
                  frictionless, administrative workload dropped significantly,
                  and user satisfaction rose. The community responded with
                  positive feedback, and the internal team regained confidence
                  in managing digital tools. What began as a derailed project
                  became a compelling example of adaptive leadership and
                  strategic recovery.
                </p>
                <p>
                  This experience reinforced several lasting lessons for me:
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    Simplicity scales. A lean, well-matched solution often
                    outperforms custom builds when time, budget, and resources
                    are limited.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Do your reference checks. Past experience is a critical
                    indicator, taking time to thoroughly vet vendors and
                    developers can prevent costly setbacks. Don't pay to be
                    someone's practice project by funding a learning curve with
                    your own time, budget, and reputation.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Choose aligned partners. Work with people who share your
                    values, not just your contract. Partners should be invested
                    in your success, and recommend what’s truly best for your
                    organization.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Build for sustainability. Tools should empower teams
                    long-term, not lock them into external dependency.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Adaptability is a superpower. When plans collapse, a
                    well-informed pivot can turn failure into lasting success.

                <p>
                  Every year, the Resort Municipality of Whistler (RMOW)
                  produces a comprehensive Corporate Plan and Annual Report to
                  outline its strategic priorities, key performance indicators,
                  and departmental achievements. Given its importance as both a
                  public-facing and internal planning document, it needs to be
                  clear, visually engaging, and reflective of the community’s
                  identity.
                </p>
                <p>
                  I’ve been responsible for designing this report annually for
                  several years. Each year, I collaborate with internal
                  departments to gather content, understand evolving priorities,
                  and ensure the design reflects both current municipal goals
                  and the established RMOW brand.
                </p>
                <p>
                  I apply consistent typographic hierarchy and visual structure
                  to make the report easy to navigate, while also updating
                  elements year over year to keep the design fresh.

                    >2025 edition</a
                  >, I was inspired by the intersection of our increasingly
                  digital world and Whistler’s deep connection to nature. To
                  represent this balance, I integrated stylized generated
                  wireframe animal illustrations throughout the report—symbols
                  of local wildlife rendered in a modern, geometric form. These
                  visuals bridged the organic and the digital, subtly
                  reinforcing RMOW’s vision of progress rooted in environmental
                  stewardship.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The finished Corporate Plan was delivered on schedule and
                  well-received by Council and staff. It continues to serve as a
                  key resource for both strategic reference and public
                  communication, and my ongoing involvement each year has helped
                  maintain a consistent, high-quality standard for this critical
                  municipal document.

                  As part of the Resort Municipality of Whistler’s Corporate
                  Plan update, I was tasked with showing how key strategic
                  initiatives had progressed over the previous year. The
                  challenge was to present municipal data—typically buried in
                  spreadsheets and reports—in a format the community could
                  quickly understand and connect with.
                </p>
                <p>
                  I was responsible for designing a visual snippet that would
                  communicate this progress clearly and effectively. The goal
                  was to turn raw statistics into a visual snapshot of municipal
                  achievements.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The final design snippet successfully distilled a year’s worth
                  of progress into a one-glance visual, making it easier for the
                  public, stakeholders, and Council to see the tangible impact
                  of their initiatives. It was used in both internal
                  presentations and public-facing materials, helping reinforce
                  transparency and build trust through design.

                  As Whistler Sailing’s official photographer, I’ve had the
                  opportunity to capture the unique energy and spirit of life on
                  the water. The team needed a consistent visual presence that
                  could authentically reflect the excitement of the sport and
                  deepen its connection with the community.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Focusing on emotion, movement, and the natural beauty of our
                  surroundings, I composed each shot to feel immersive and
                  story-driven - bringing moments to life through thoughtful
                  framing and timing.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The resulting photography has been used across digital
                  platforms, marketing campaigns, and community outreach
                  materials - consistently driving higher engagement and
                  audience connection. These images have helped Whistler Sailing
                  present not just a program, but an experience, inviting people
                  in and encouraging them to be part of the story.

                  The Resort Municipality of Whistler needed a PowerPoint
                  template that could serve multiple departments, meet varying
                  presentation needs, and still reflect a unified, professional
                  brand identity. The existing template was outdated, creating
                  friction and reduced visual impact across the organization’s
                  communications.
                </p>
                <p>
                  I took on the responsibility of designing and maintaining
                  RMOW’s official PowerPoint template (.potx). My creative
                  process began with a deep dive into the municipality’s vision
                  statement and current Council priorities to ensure the visuals
                  aligned with core values and strategic direction. This
                  foundation resulted in a design that feels both purposeful and
                  inspiring. To keep the design fresh and engaging, I
                  implemented seasonal updates, rotating visual themes while
                  strictly maintaining brand consistency through typography,
                  color, and layout structure.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The updated templates have improved both the look and
                  usability of internal and external presentations. They’ve made
                  it easier for staff across departments to produce
                  high-quality, on-brand materials with minimal effort,
                  supporting clearer communication and a stronger municipal
                  identity.

                  Every few years, Whistler Sailing undertakes a refresh of its
                  print materials to align with new programs, evolving branding,
                  and shifting audience needs. As part of this ongoing
                  collaboration, I lead the design of promotional assets that
                  support outreach to both locals and visitors—from first-time
                  sailors to seasoned racers. The challenge is to create pieces
                  that stand out in busy display environments, communicate
                  information quickly, and stay true to the organization’s
                  identity.

                  I design a variety of marketing collateral, including posters,
                  brochures, and rack cards, each piece tailored to its message
                  and audience. My process emphasizes high-impact visuals,
                  strong typographic hierarchy, and clean, accessible layouts
                  that guide the viewer through key content with ease.

                  Each design maintains brand consistency while allowing room

                  Whistler Sailing was launching a brand-new program: wing
                  foiling. As an emerging sport with huge visual appeal but low
                  local awareness, the goal was to quickly introduce it to the
                  Sea to Sky audience and generate buzz. We needed a piece of
                  content that could grab attention, communicate the thrill of
                  the sport, and drive clicks.
                </p>
                <p>
                  I took the lead on editing and producing a high-energy reel
                  tailored for mobile-first platforms. Drawing from on-water
                  footage, I crafted a 60-second short that emphasized action,
                  flow, and the stunning backdrop of Whistler’s landscape. Every
                  choice—from pacing and transitions to soundtrack—was made to
                  reflect the excitement of wing foiling while staying visually
                  on-brand. I specifically selected clips that made the sport
                  look inviting and achievable, steering away from anything that
                  might feel intimidating to newcomers.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The video was launched with targeted social media ads across
                  Instagram, Facebook, and YouTube. It quickly gained traction,
                  generating early interest and giving Whistler Sailing a
                  reusable visual asset to promote the program throughout the
                  season—built to spark curiosity, clicks, and conversions.
