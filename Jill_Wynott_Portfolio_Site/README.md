# Portfolio Styles Interactions

## Project Overview
This project is designed to showcase a simple portfolio webpage with interactive scrollytelling and style toggling features. Users can switch between four different styles to customize their viewing experience.

## Files Included
- **index.html**: The main HTML document that structures the webpage and links to the CSS and JavaScript files.
- **styles.css**: Contains the styles for the webpage, defining the appearance of elements and including styles for four different themes.
- **script.js**: JavaScript code that enables the scrollytelling and toggling between the four different styles based on user interaction.

## How to Use
1. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.
2. Use the provided buttons or controls to toggle between the four different styles.
3. The styles will change dynamically, allowing you to see the effects immediately.

## Themes
The project includes four distinct themes:
- Theme 1: Light Mode - Clean and minimal.
- Theme 2: Dark Mode - Sleek and contrast-heavy.
- Theme 3: Colour Config Mode - A more expressive, branded palette.
- Theme 4: Dev Mode - A playful mode featuring interactive extras.

## Installation
No installation is required. Simply download the project files and open `index.html` in your preferred web browser.

## A Note on Scrollytelling
This project experiments with a lightweight version of scrollytelling—a narrative format triggered by scroll behavior—to guide the user through the portfolio in a more engaging way.

## Known Issues
There is an intermittent bug where portfolio pop-ups lose their headings and content after switching in and out of Dev Mode. The issue is difficult to reproduce consistently and appears to be related to how elements are reset during theme changes.
