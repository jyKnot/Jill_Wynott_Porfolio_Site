    <h1>Interactive Personal Website - Assignment 2</h1>
    <br />
    <h3>Jill Wynott</h3>
    <h2>One Page Summary</h2>
    <br /><br />

    <h3>Evolving from Assignment 1</h3>
    <p>
      After reviewing my first assignment, I used this opportunity to redesign
      my portfolio site into something more dynamic and interactive. I moved
      away from a block-based, image heavy structure and leaned into a cleaner,
      story-driven experience. I have always been curious about scrollytelling,
      and generally like it, but hadn't experimented with it before, so I made
      that a core component. I also aimed to implement a dark mode, which grew
      in scope into four distinct themes.
    </p>
    <br />
    <h3>Starting from Scratch</h3>
    <p>
      This second assignment uses entirely new code. A personal goal was to
      create something that could be launched confidently on due day, being
      fully functional and stable. I incorporated feedback from Assignment 1 and
      used an online code validation tool (FreeFormatter) to clean up errors and
      improve structure.
    </p>
    <br /><br />
    <h2>Challenges</h2>
    <h3>JavaScript</h3>
    <p>
      JavaScript was by far the biggest hurdle. My process was very
      result-driven: I envisioned what I wanted the final experience to be and
      then worked backward to figure out how to make it happen. While I feel I
      have learned JavaScript basics through class session and practice, I still
      leaned heavily on AI tools to troubleshoot and bring my ideas to life.
      That said, I made sure I understood what each line of code was doing. I
      have realized that for me, learning JavaScript will likely come more out
      of necessity than pure interest, and is something I will need to continue
      working on.
    </p>
    <br />
    <h3>The Bug</h3>
    <p>
      There is an unresolved bug that's proven difficult to isolate. After
      entering and exiting the Dev theme, the portfolio popups sometimes lose
      their headings and content. It doesn't happen consistently, and I haven't
      been able to replicate it reliably, making debugging quite challenging.
    </p>
    <br />
    <h3>Dev mode 'Coolness'</h3>
    <p>
      Initially, I had planned a more playful Dev Mode experience, but scope
      creep, especially around JavaScript, quickly became overwhelming. In the
      end, I chose to integrate the Chrome Dino game as a simple, nostalgic
      fallback that still added interaction. This was also my first time
      extracting code from GitHub, which was an empowering milestone.
    </p>
    <br />
    <h2>Wins & Reflections</h2>
    <p>
      Despite the bug and the learning curve, I think I'm proud of the outcome.
      The site feels more “me” than anything I've built before. I also really
      appreciated the creative flexibility of working from a blank canvas rather
      than within the constraints of a template.
    </p>
    <br />

    <h2>Feedback</h2>
    <p>
      I'm wondering if I can pick your brain and ask a few industry-related
      questions specific to my site. As someone new to this field, I'm eager to
      learn what works, and what doesn't, from a professional perspective.
      Thanks in advance!
